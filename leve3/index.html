        What if a writer or novelist decided to write a 300-page book with no breaks in the text for new ideas, new
        chapters, or even character dialogue? It would be so overwhelming that the reader would probably take one look
        and close the book forever. When writing is divided up into manageable parts that are cohesive, it's much easier
        for the reader to take in and process. A paragraph is a distinct segment of writing, often includes more than
        one sentence, and is separated from other paragraphs and text by a space.
