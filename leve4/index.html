        <p id="content1">This handout will help you understand how paragraphs are formed, how to develop stronger
            paragraphs, and how to completely and clearly express your ideas.</p>
        <p id="content2">Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of
            length: a
            paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though,
            the
            unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a
            group
            of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do
            not
            determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
            journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or
            group
            of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,”
            because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
        <p id="content3">
            Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first
            decide
            on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are
            trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other
            words,
            your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the
            information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas,
            will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where
            there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.

            The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; this
            “germination process” is better known as brainstorming. There are many techniques for brainstorming;
            whichever
            one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs can be like
            building
            a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are building. Any cracks,
            inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.

            So, let’s suppose that you have done some brainstorming to develop your thesis. What else should you keep in
            mind as you begin to create paragraphs? Every paragraph in a paper should be:

            Unified: All of the sentences in a single paragraph should be related to a single controlling idea (often
            expressed in the topic sentence of the paragraph).
            Clearly related to the thesis: The sentences should all refer to the central idea, or thesis, of the paper
            (Rosen and Behrens 119).
            Coherent: The sentences should be arranged in a logical manner and should follow a definite plan for
            development
            (Rosen and Behrens 119).
            Well-developed: Every idea discussed in the paragraph should be adequately explained and supported through
            evidence and details that work together to explain the paragraph’s controlling idea (Rosen and Behrens 119).

        <p id="content4">There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend
            on
            the controlling
            idea of the paragraph. <strong>Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief
                examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Narration</strong>: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (<a
                    title="Paragraph Development Examples"
                    href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/">See
                an
                example.</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes,
                sounds,
                or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (<a
                        title="Paragraph Development Examples"
                        href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/">See
                    an example.</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Process</strong>: Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequence—first,
                second, third. (<a title="Paragraph Development Examples"
                                   href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/">See
                    an example.</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Classification</strong>: Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. (<a
                    title="Paragraph Development Examples"
                    href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/">See
                an
                example.</a>)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Illustration</strong>: Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. (See an
                example in the 5-step process below.)

1. New Line: Start on a new line.                Flow: Stay in line with text.
2. Full Width: Take up all horizontal space.     Width: Just as wide as the content.
3. Styling: Can have margins and padding.        Limited Styling: Can't easily.
4. Size: Width and height can be set.            No Break: No new line between elements.
5. Examples: div, p, h1, ul, li.                 Examples: span, a, strong, em, img.
